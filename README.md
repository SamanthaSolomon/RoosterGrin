# front-end-dev-test

## Intro

Congratulations on making it to the testing phase of the hiring process! For this part, we would like to learn about your <mark>creativity, how well you code, and how well you follow instructions.</mark>

You will need to have knowledge of some key things before you start:
  - how to run a local server
  - how to connect your markup to your scripts and styles
  - front end web development

We have supplied an optional development server and some development dependencies for this project, but feel free to use the development framework of your choice (e.g. create-react-app, vue cli, etc). You are not required to use the codebase provided in this repository, but feel free to use it! If you choose to use this codebase, you can run the development server using the commands found below:

<pre>
  npm install
  npm start
</pre>

<em>NOTE: You will need node and npm on your machine if you choose to use the supplied server, also for hosting you will need to set it up yourself.</em>

## Instructions

The goal of this project is to create a client website that has some key features requested by the client (i.e. Rooster Grin as the client).

Please clone this repo and <mark>submit a link to the new project's repo along with any instructions for viewing the final product.</mark> It is not required to host this project anywhere, but <mark>it would be nice to view your project via a link rather than having to run the build locally.</mark>
